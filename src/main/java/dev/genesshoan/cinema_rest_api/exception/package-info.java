/**

 *
 * Domain-specific exception types used across the application.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Define clear, intention-revealing exception classes for common error conditions (e.g., resource not found, already exists).
 * - Keep exception types small and focused so that handlers can map them to appropriate HTTP responses.
